# Agent Framework / Foundry SDK Alignment

## Context and Problem Statement

Agent Framework and Foundry SDK have overlapping functionality but serve different audiences & scenarios. 
This specification clarifies the positioning of these SDKs to customers, what goes in each and when to use what. 

- **Foundry SDK** is a thin-client SDK for accessing everything available in the agent service and is autogenerated from REST APIs in multiple languages 
- **Agent Framework SDK** is general-purpose framework for agentic application development, with common agent abstractions enable creating and orchestrating heterogenous agent systems (across local & cloud)


## Decision Drivers

- Developers can seamlessly combine Foundry and Agent Framework SDK's and there is no friction when using both SDKs at the same time
- Developers can take advantage of the full capabilities supported by the Foundry SDK
- Developers can create multi-agent orchestrations using Foundry and other agent types
- …

## Considered Options

- {title of option 1}
- {title of option 2}
- {title of option 3}
- … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### {title of option 1}

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

- Good, because {argument a}
- Good, because {argument b}
<!-- use "neutral" if the given argument weights neither for good nor bad -->
- Neutral, because {argument c}
- Bad, because {argument d}
- … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### {title of other option}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

- Good, because {argument a}
- Good, because {argument b}
- Neutral, because {argument c}
- Bad, because {argument d}
- …
