### 1. Configure required environment variables

This samples used Azure OpenAI by default so you need to set the following environment variable

``` powershell
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "https://<your deployment>.openai.azure.com/"
```

If you want to use OpenAI

1. Edit [Program.cs](./demos/MinimalConsole/Program.cs)
    ```csharp
    ```
2. Create an environment variable with your OpenAI key 
    ``` powershell
    $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
    ```

### 2. Build the project

```powershell
cd demos\MinimalConsole
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Run the demonstration

``` powershell
dotnet run --framework net9.0 --no-build
```

Sample output:
